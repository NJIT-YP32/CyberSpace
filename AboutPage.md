*"The Internet's evolution is a story of many, many contributions. Each of the individuals in the Internet Titans made an important contribution to that history."*

* This is the age of Internet or we can say a global network of communication that turn 21st century people around the world to exchange messages, finding information free and even tyranny computer communication can also be a tool of war to manage material and manpower.
* Now what began as a million dollar investment by the government in 1969 to link computers to share information was now at the turn of the century the future at present there are over 11 million domain names registered on the Internet and nearly 70 million web sites **www** and **@** are the new icons of the Information Age with the enormous use of the internet and the web innovation and evolution will continue and it will reinvent communications of all kinds.
* The Internet is only 30 years old and it's got a lot of future ahead of it so don't think for a moment that this little look at the history is going to capture it all because it's happening right now even as we sit here.
*	**Sir Tim Berner-lee** Inventor of the **World Wide Web** says *"Its originally the idea of the web was that it would be a two-way thing that he would be able to contribute and the web over the last decade has missed that we are returning to the idea of a read/write web so the fact that it's a space in which people can write a blog and contribute to a wiki is really exciting for me because they bring back the common person as the author."*
*	The general direction of the changes that are coming for the web bigger, faster, more social, more pervasive, more all-consuming. 
*	We're all enveloping whether we like it or not the web has taken on a life of its own it's autocatalytic .
